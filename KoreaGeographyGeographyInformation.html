            <h1>South Korea: Geography Overview</h1>

            <p>
                South Korea occupies the <span class="highlight">southern half of the Korean Peninsula</span> in East Asia.
                It is bordered by the <span class="highlight">Yellow Sea</span> to the west, the 
                <span class="highlight">Sea of Japan (East Sea)</span> to the east, and the 
                <span class="highlight">Korea Strait</span> to the south. Its only land border is with
                <span class="highlight">North Korea</span> along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), one of the most
                heavily fortified borders in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                The country is largely mountainous, especially in the east where the 
                <span class="highlight">Taebaek Mountains</span> run parallel to the coastline.
                As a result, most major cities and farmland lie in the 
                <span class="highlight">western and southern lowlands</span>.
                The highest peak is <span class="highlight">Hallasan</span>, a dormant volcano on Jeju Island,
                rising 1,947 meters above sea level.
            </p>

            <p>
                Several rivers shape the nation's geography. The 
                <span class="highlight">Han River</span> flows through Seoul and has long served
                as a vital transportation and economic artery. Other major rivers include the 
                <span class="highlight">Nakdong</span> and <span class="highlight">Geum</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                South Korea has a temperate climate with 
                <span class="highlight">four distinct seasons</span>: cold winters, warm springs,
                hot monsoon summers, and cool autumns. Most rainfall occurs in summer, often during
                short and intense monsoon periods. The country also experiences 
                <span class="highlight">late-summer typhoons</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although relatively small, South Korea contains diverse ecosystems—from coastal 
                wetlands to alpine forests. Jeju Island’s volcanic landscape, including lava tubes,
                is so unique that it is recognized as a 
                <span class="highlight">UNESCO World Heritage Site</span>.
