            <img src="JoseonMain.jpg" alt="Joseon Dynasty Image" class="photo">

            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">Joseon Dynasty</span>, founded by <span class="highlight">Yi Seong-gye (King Taejo)</span> in 1392, 
                ruled Korea for over 500 years, making it one of the longest dynasties in East Asian history.  
                It shaped Korea’s identity through Confucian values, scholarly governance, and major cultural 
                achievements that still influence the Korean Peninsula today.
            </p>

            <!-- GOVERNMENT & SOCIETY -->
            <h2>Government and Society</h2>
            <img src="JoseonYangban.jpg" alt="Yangban Scholars" class="photo">
            <p>
                Joseon established a highly organized and centralized government led by the king.  
                The ruling class, known as the <span class="highlight">yangban</span>, consisted of scholar-officials who 
                studied Confucian texts and served in government posts.  
                Entry into the bureaucracy was determined through the <span class="highlight">civil service examinations</span>, 
                which tested knowledge of Confucian philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Society was structured into clear classes:  
                <span class="highlight">yangban (nobles)</span>,  
                <span class="highlight">commoners</span>,  
                and <span class="highlight">slaves (nobi)</span>.  
                Confucian ideals shaped daily life, emphasizing family loyalty, education, morality, and social order.
            </p>

            <!-- CULTURE & SCIENCE -->
            <h2>Culture and Science</h2>
            <img src="Hangul.jpg" alt="Hangul Creation" class="photo">
            <p>
                The Joseon era produced major cultural and intellectual achievements.  
                One of the most significant contributions was the creation of 
                <span class="highlight">Hangul</span>, the Korean alphabet, invented in 1443 by 
                <span class="highlight">King Sejong the Great</span> to improve literacy among common people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advances in science, astronomy, agriculture, and medicine flourished.  
                The dynasty also saw the development of traditional <span class="highlight">Korean ceramics</span>, 
                landscape painting, and classical literature.
            </p>

            <!-- RELIGION -->
            <h2>Buddhism and Confucianism</h2>
            <img src="JoseonConfucian.jpg" alt="Confucian Rituals" class="photo">
            <p>
                Although Buddhism had been influential in previous dynasties,  
                <span class="highlight">Neo-Confucianism</span> became the dominant ideology in Joseon.  
                It shaped government laws, education, family structure, and social values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buddhism was restricted but survived through mountain temples, monastic communities, 
                and religious art. These temples became centers of spiritual life outside major cities.
            </p>

            <!-- DEFENSE & FOREIGN RELATIONS -->
            <h2>Defense and Foreign Relations</h2>
            <img src="ImjinWar.jpg" alt="Imjin War" class="photo">
            <p>
                Joseon faced several external threats, including the  
                <span class="highlight">Japanese invasions (1592–1598)</span>, known as the 
                <span class="highlight">Imjin War</span>.  
                Korean naval commander <span class="highlight">Admiral Yi Sun-sin</span> famously defended the peninsula using 
                innovative turtle ships.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 17th century, Joseon endured invasions by the <span class="highlight">Manchus</span>, 
                but despite these conflicts, the dynasty continued to evolve culturally and politically.
            </p>

            <!-- LEGACY -->
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <img src="Gyeongbokgung.jpg" alt="Gyeongbokgung Palace" class="photo">
            <p>
                The Joseon Dynasty profoundly shaped Korean culture, language, and social structure.  
                Its palaces—such as <span class="highlight">Gyeongbokgung</span> and <span class="highlight">Changdeokgung</span>—remain 
                iconic symbols of Korean history.  
                Confucian traditions established during Joseon continued to influence Korea into the modern era.
