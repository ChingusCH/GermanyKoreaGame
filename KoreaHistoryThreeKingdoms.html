            <h1>The Three Kingdoms Period (57 BCE – 668 CE)</h1>

            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">Three Kingdoms period</span> is one of the most defining eras in early Korean history. 
                From 57 BCE to 668 CE, three powerful kingdoms—<span class="highlight">Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla</span>—
                coexisted, competing for land, trade, and political dominance across the Korean Peninsula.
                This era witnessed major cultural, military, and technological development that shaped early Korean civilization.
            </p>

            <!-- Goguryeo -->
            <h2>1. Goguryeo</h2>
            <img src="Goguryeo.jpg" alt="Goguryeo" class="photo">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Goguryeo</span> occupied the northern Korean Peninsula and extended deep into 
                Manchuria (modern-day China). Renowned for its strong military, powerful cavalry, and 
                fortress cities, Goguryeo was a dominant power in Northeast Asia.  
                The kingdom defended its territory from multiple Chinese dynasties and played a crucial 
                role in expanding Korean cultural influence northward.
            </p>

            <!-- Baekje -->
            <h2>2. Baekje</h2>
            <img src="Baekje.jpg" alt="Baekje" class="photo">
            <p>
                Located in the southwest, <span class="highlight">Baekje</span> was known for its refined culture, 
                maritime trade networks, and diplomatic ties with Japan and China.  
                Baekje was instrumental in spreading <span class="highlight">Buddhism</span>, writing systems, and artistic 
                traditions across East Asia. Its elegant architecture and art remain some of the most admired 
                legacies of early Korean civilization.
            </p>

            <!-- Silla -->
            <h2>3. Silla</h2>
            <img src="Silla.jpg" alt="Silla" class="photo">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Silla</span>, located in the southeast, began as the smallest of the three kingdoms.  
                Through strategic diplomacy and military alliances—especially with the <span class="highlight">Tang Dynasty</span>—
                Silla gradually expanded its territory.  
                In 668 CE, it unified most of the Korean Peninsula, marking the beginning of the Unified Silla period.  
                Silla is celebrated for its <span class="highlight">gold crowns</span>, advanced Buddhist art, and remarkable 
                achievements in culture and governance.
            </p>

            <!-- Cultural Impact -->
            <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
            <img src="ThreeKingdomsCulture.jpg" alt="Cultural Artifacts" class="photo">
            <p>
                The Three Kingdoms period produced significant advancements in <span class="highlight">art, religion, law, 
                and statecraft</span>. Buddhism spread rapidly, shaping architecture and sculpture while influencing 
                everyday life.  
                Each kingdom developed distinct systems of administration, diplomacy, and military organization.  
                Modern archaeology continues to reveal tomb murals, fortresses, artifacts, and temple ruins that 
                highlight the era's technological progress and artistic brilliance.
